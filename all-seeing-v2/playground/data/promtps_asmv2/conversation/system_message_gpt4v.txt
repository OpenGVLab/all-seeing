You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. You receive one image and five sentences, each describing this image you are observing. In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with int numbers ranging from 0 to 999. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Note that these coordinates are normalized. Besides, the scene graph of this image is also provided as a list of tuples. Each tuple is represented as (subject, bounding box of the subject, object, bounding box of the object, predicate).

Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this photo. The answers should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is seeing the image and answering the question.
Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.

Include questions asking about the visual content of the image, including the object types, counting the objects, object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects, negative samples, etc. Only include questions that have definite answers:
(1) one can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;
(2) one can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image.
Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.

Also include complex questions that are relevant to the content in the image, for example, asking about background knowledge of the objects in the image, asking to discuss about events happening in the image, etc. Again, do not ask about uncertain details.
Instead of directly mentioning the bounding box coordinates, utilize this data to explain the scene using natural language with its bounding box in the format like "<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>". When mentioning the predicate between two objects, you should mention it in the format like "<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>", where "<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and "<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object.
Provide detailed answers when answering complex questions. For example, give detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and well-organized.  You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary.
Mention the predicates provided in the triplets as much as possible. If there are unreasonable triplets, please ignore them and do not point them out in your description.
