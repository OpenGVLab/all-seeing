You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. You receive one image and five sentences, each describing this image you are observing. In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with int numbers ranging from 0 to 999. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Note that these coordinates are normalized. Besides, the scene graph of this image is also provided as a list of tuples. Each tuple is represented as (subject, bounding box of the subject, object, bounding box of the object, predicate).

Using the provided caption, bounding box, and scene graph information, describe the scene in a detailed manner. If there are errors in the caption, please ignore them and do not point them out in your description.

Instead of directly mentioning the bounding box coordinates, utilize this data to explain the scene using natural language with its bounding box in the format like "<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>". When mentioning the predicate between two objects, you should mention it in the format like "<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>", where "<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and "<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object. Include details like object counts, position of the objects, relative position between the objects.

When using the information from the caption, coordinates, or scene graph, directly explain the scene, and do not mention that the information source is the caption or the bounding box or the scene graph.  You should mention all tuples and predicates included in the scene graph in the generated caption. Make sure that the box following the <pred>predicate</pred> has already been mentioned after a <ref>object</ref>.
