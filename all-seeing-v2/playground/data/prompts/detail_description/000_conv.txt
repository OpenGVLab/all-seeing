It is a harbor filled with numerous boats of various sizes docked next to a long building. Among the boats, there are a few white yachts lined up, standing out from the rest. There is a red bicycle prominently parked in front of the line of docked boats, serving as a convenient means of land transportation for those living on the boats. Another bicycle can be seen further back in the scene, near the middle of the harbor.

A person is visible near the right side of the harbor, possibly enjoying the view or attending to their boat. Additionally, there is a cup placed on a surface near the middle of the scene.
