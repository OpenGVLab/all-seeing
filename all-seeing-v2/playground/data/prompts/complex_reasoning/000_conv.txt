Question:
What is unusual about this photo?
===
Answer:
In the photo, the man is wearing a total of ten ties around his neck. This is considered unusual because it is not common for someone to wear multiple ties at once. In a typical setting, a person would wear only one tie. The man's goofy facial expression also adds to the unconventional and humorous nature of the image.
