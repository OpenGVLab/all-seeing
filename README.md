This is the official implementation of the paper "The All-Seeing Project: Towards Panoptic Visual Recognition and Understanding of the Open World". (The name "All-Seeing" is derived from "The All-Seeing Eye", which means having complete knowledge, awareness, or insight into all aspects of existence. The logo is Millennium Puzzle, an artifact from the manga "Yu-Gi-Oh!")

## News and Updates
- `Aug 29, 2023`: üöÄ [**All-Seeing Model Demo**](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/wangweiyun/All-Seeing-Model-Demo) and [**Dataset Browser**](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/wangweiyun/All-Seeing-Dataset-Browser) are available on the OpenXLab now!

## Schedule

- [ ] Release the human verification results of AS-1B.
- [ ] Release the detailed region annotations of AS-1B.
- [ ] Release the semantic tags of AS-1B.
- [x] Online demo, including dataset browser and ASM online demo.

## Introduction 
We present the All-Seeing Project with:

***All-Seeing 1B (AS-1B) dataset***: we propose a new large-scale dataset (AS-1B) for open-world panoptic visual recognition and understanding, using an economical semi-automatic data engine that combines the power of off-the-shelf vision/language models and human feedback.

***All-Seeing Model (ASM)***: we develop a unified vision-language foundation model (ASM) for open-world panoptic visual recognition and understanding. Aligning with LLMs, our ASM supports versatile image-text retrieval and generation tasks, demonstrating impressive zero-shot capability.

## Dataset Overview
AS-1B with over 1 billion regions annotated with semantic tags, question-answering pairs, and detailed captions. It covers a wide range of 3.5 million common and rare concepts in the real world, and has 132.2 billion tokens that describe the concepts and their attributes.

## Model Architecture

The All-Seeing model (ASM) is a unified framework for panoptic visual recognition and understanding, including image/region-text retrieval, image/region recognition, captioning, and question-answering.
